===================

The Ultimate Mathbook teaches users techniques to solve math problems.  Unlike traditional textbooks, the Ultimate Mathbook lets users try the same math problem multiple times.  It also provides instructions on how to do them.  The app is divided into chapters.  There are currently three chapters: Rate Problems, Percent Problems, and Consecutive Integer problems.  The Ultimate Mathbook is password protected and asks users for their emails so that, in the future, the site administrator can contact users with support and marketing materials.

The app includes the following features:

*Security features including:
	**JavaScript login validation so that users cannot enter an empty field
	**Client side validation so that the same email can't be used twice

*Password hashing

*Email confirmation of account creation

*3 'chapters' that can be accessed through the top horizontal menu
	**These 'chapters' are Rate Problems, Percent Problems and Consecutive Integer Porblems
	**There are two sections to each chapter, separated by the JQuerry Accordian plugin
		***The first section tells the user how to do the problem
		***The second section lets the user try an example problem
		***Both sections are collapsable using JQuery

*Users can try the same problem over and over again.  Each time they try again, new numbers and answer are generated.  This is built with JQuery.
	**Users get a message if they get the problem wrong or right
	**Users can submit an answer by clicking the Check Answer button or pressing enter
